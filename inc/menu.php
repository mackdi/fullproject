    Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game
    developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game was released for
    Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in July 2013,[1][2] following a
    Windows-only public beta testing phase that began in 2011, and is the
    stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a mod for
    Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne.
    Dota 2 is one of the most actively played games on Steam, with maximum
    peaks of over a million concurrent players.[3][4][5]
    Dota 2 is played in matches between two five-player teams, each of which
    occupies a stronghold in a corner of the playing field. A team wins by
    destroying the other side's "Ancient" building, located within the opposing
    stronghold. Each player controls one of 111 playable "Hero" characters that
    feature unique powers and styles of play. During a match, the player
    collects gold, items, and experience points for their Hero, while combating
    Heroes of the opposite team.
